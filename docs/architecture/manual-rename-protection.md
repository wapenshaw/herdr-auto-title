# Manual Rename Protection

Rename a tab yourself and Auto Title leaves it alone from then on. The same
holds for a pane, which Auto Title names too unless that is turned off.

There is nothing to correlate a rename with. The plugin polls rather than
subscribing, so a rename is not an event that arrives but **a label that has
changed between two polls**. The whole design follows from that, and it lives in
`internal/labels`: the rule in `claims.go`, and in `labels.go` the pass that
runs it over one poll, sends the renames and records what became of them. The
order those steps run in is the package's own, and the poll loop asks only for
a tab, a pane or a workspace row to be named.

## The rule

A tab is the user's work when its label moved to something Auto Title neither
set nor would have set. Three things are compared on every poll
(`claims.observe`):

- **Current** — the label the snapshot reports.
- **Desired** — what the resolver would name the tab right now.
- **Seen** — the label Auto Title last observed or set for that tab.

A label equal to *Desired* is never the user's: it cannot be told from Auto
Title's own work, and it is harmless either way. A label equal to *Seen*
has not moved, so nobody did anything. Anything else moved, and whoever moved
it was not the plugin.

`claims.applied` records each successful rename, so the plugin's own work never
reads as the user's on the next poll.

## Two traps this design walked into

Both were found by running it, not by reading it.

### The first poll is not each tab's first sighting

**The first poll never locks a tab or a pane.** On startup almost every tab
carries a label that is not yet what the resolver would produce, and locking on
that would claim the whole session at once.

Applied per *tab* rather than per *poll*, the same rule loses names. A tab
created and named faster than the next poll is first seen already carrying the
user's name — and the rule said not to lock it, so Auto Title renamed it over.

They are told apart by what Herdr calls a tab nobody has named. After the first
poll, a tab Auto Title has never seen is one that did not exist before, and a new
tab already carrying something other than its default label was named by whoever
made it.

### Herdr's default label is a position, not `TabInfo.number`

The default label was first read from `TabInfo.number`. It is not that.
`number` counts every tab a workspace has ever held and never repeats — six tabs
were seen numbered 2, 9, 30, 33, 35, 36 — while the label on an unnamed tab is
its **position** in the workspace, so that sixth tab was labelled `6`.

The guard therefore compared `6` against `36`, never fired, and **every tab
created after the first poll was locked the moment it appeared**, written to the
lock file, and never named again. From the outside Auto Title looked like it had
simply stopped working on new tabs.

The position is in no field: tabs arrive from `session.snapshot` in display
order, so it is their count within the workspace (`App.tabsIn`).

The label also comes back — when a tab is unnamed again, and when every tab
shifts one place left because a tab before it closed. So **a tab wearing its
default label is nobody's, seen before or not**, and that check runs ahead of the
others for every tab. The cost is a user who renames a tab to exactly the digits
of its position and is not protected, which is the same trade the *Desired*
check already makes.

There is a second shape of it. A tab nobody has named reports its position, but
**clearing a name stores the empty string** — `tab.rename` keeps exactly what it
is given, and the tab bar renders the position for both. Until that was probed,
clearing a tab's name read as a rename to a label Auto Title had never seen, so
the gesture a user reaches for to hand a tab back was the one that locked it for
good. An empty label is therefore nobody's too, on the same line as the
position.

### A rename can land after its call has failed

`claims.applied` runs only when `tab.rename` answers. A call can also give up —
the poll's deadline passes while Herdr is stalled — after Herdr has already
read the request, and Herdr then applies it whenever it gets to it. Measured, a
stalled server applied renames 3 to 18 seconds after receiving them, while
another plugin's tab bar command kept timing out.

By then the name wanted has often moved on: a tab to the left closed and every
position slid, or the poll that reads the late label was itself cut short. The
tab carries a label that is neither *Seen* nor *Desired*, the rule reads it as
the user's, and **the tab is locked on a stale number for good**. In the session
where it was found, ten of twelve locked tabs had a late rename as their last
one.

So the label of a rename whose request was sent but got no answer
(`herdr.ErrUnanswered`) is kept per tab (`claims.sent`), and a tab found wearing
one is Auto Title's, like one wearing *Desired*, and is renamed on. The label is
forgotten once it lands or the tab closes. Recording the label as *Seen* up
front instead would be wrong the other way: a rename that never lands would
leave the old label looking moved, and lock that.

Only a request that was sent is kept. A call Herdr answered with an error was
refused, not deferred. A call that failed before its request was sent never
reached Herdr: a dial refused, or one made once the poll's deadline had passed,
as it has for a rename right after a process read that stalled.
Kept all the same, its label would pass for Auto Title's, and a user who then
chose that name would have it renamed away.

## Locks outlive the process, guarded by the label

Herdr can restart a plugin mid-session, and losing every manual name to that is
a worse surprise than the plugin briefly stopping. Locks are therefore persisted
(`manual-names.json`, written through a temporary file and renamed into place).

But Herdr's tab ids belong to a session, so a stored `wE:t2` may be an unrelated
tab by the time it is read back. **A lock records the label it was taken with**
and is released if the tab no longer carries it (`claims.retain`, which also
drops everything about tabs the session no longer holds).

The cost of that guard is stated plainly: **a rename made while the plugin is
not running is not remembered.** It cannot be told apart from an id reused by a
different session, and wrongly locking a stranger's tab is worse than forgetting
a rename made in the seconds the plugin was down.

## Handing a tab back

**Clear the tab's name and Auto Title takes it again**, on the next poll, with
the plugin running. Nothing implements that: `retain` releases the lock because
the label moved off the one it was taken with, and `observe` declines to take a
new one because an unnamed tab is nobody's. Renaming the tab to its position
does the same thing for the same reason.

Renaming it to anything else does **not** hand it back. The lock is released and
retaken within the poll, now on the new label — which is what keeps a tab the
user renames twice theirs.

What remains impossible while the plugin runs is releasing a lock without
touching the tab. The way to that is still to stop the plugin, remove the tab's
entry from `manual-names.json` (or delete the file), and start it again —
editing the file under a running plugin achieves nothing, because the locks live
in memory and the file is rewritten from them.

A `reset` subcommand talking to the running process over a control channel of
its own is specified and not built.

## Panes are protected the same way, and separately

Auto Title can name panes as well as tabs
([configuration](./configuration.md)), and a pane it names is a pane the user
can rename back. The rule above is the same rule: `Labels` holds one `claims`
per kind — `tabs` and `panes` — and each runs it over ids of its own. Locks for
both live in the same file, panes under `locked_panes`, so a store written by an
older version reads back unchanged. A store from a version that named
workspaces also carries `locked_workspaces` and `written_workspaces`; those are
ignored on load and gone from the next save.

Two things differ, both because Herdr labels a pane differently from a tab.

**A pane has one unnamed spelling, not two.** `pane.rename` *clears* an empty
label rather than storing it, and Herdr omits the field entirely until a pane
has a label, so an unnamed pane is `""` and nothing else. There is no position
to compare against and no `TabInfo.number` trap to walk into — the whole of
`sightingOfPane` is the pane's id, its label and what the resolver wants.

**Claiming a tab does not claim its panes.** The two are separate locks on
purpose: naming a tab by hand says what the tab bar should read, and says
nothing about how the panes inside it should be listed in the goto panel. A tab
the user has taken still has its panes named, and a pane the user has taken sits
inside a tab Auto Title goes on naming.

Handing a pane back is the same gesture with one spelling: clear its label
(`herdr pane rename <PANE_ID>`) and the next poll takes it again.

### A moved pane arrives under a new id, wearing its old label

Herdr gives a pane moved to another workspace a new id and carries its label
along ([measured](herdr-socket-api.md#what-the-objects-carry); moving to
another tab of the same workspace keeps the id). Seen from the new id that label
is neither wanted now nor one Auto Title sent, so the rule above would claim it
for the user — and with `HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_PANE_ID=true` the label names an id
the pane no longer has, so the stale id would stay for good.

`claims.retain` therefore keeps the labels of panes that vanished without being
claimed, and a pane sighted for the first time wearing one of them is Auto
Title's own, moved. The labels are kept until a poll has seen every tab —
`settle` clears them — because a poll cut short may never reach the moved
pane, and the next one no longer knows the old id. A label the user had claimed
is not kept, so a moved pane the user named stays theirs.

This applies to panes and to nothing else. A tab shares `claims`, but Herdr
does not move one under a new id — `tab.move` only reorders — so one turning up
wearing a departed label is judged like any other.

## Nothing expires

An earlier design had an expiring `ExpectedRename` to correlate a `tab_renamed`
event with the request that caused it. That race only exists when the answer
arrives separately from the question. A poll asks and is answered in the same
breath: either the label is the one Auto Title set, or it is not. What survives
of the idea is a single remembered label per tab, pruned to the live session on
every poll rather than by a clock.
