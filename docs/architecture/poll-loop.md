# The Poll Loop

Auto Title is one long-lived process that reads the whole Herdr session twice a
second and renames the tabs whose titles no longer fit. There is no scrollback
scanning, no LLM and no external service.

```
                    every 500 ms
                          │
                          ▼
                  session.snapshot ──► whole session, one request
                          │
                          ▼
              which panes changed? (revisions)
                          │
                          ▼
              per tab: pick the context pane
                          │
                          ▼
                  deterministic resolver
                          │
            title differs? ──no──► nothing
                          │
                         yes
                          ▼
                     tab.rename
```

The loop lives in `App.Run` and `App.poll` (`internal/app/app.go`).

## Polling, not events

Herdr has an event stream and Auto Title ignores it, because subscribing replays
about ten seconds of history per active pane before delivering anything live and
offers no cursor to skip it. The measurements are in
[the socket API](./herdr-socket-api.md#why-the-event-stream-is-not-used).

A snapshot describes the present, costs one request whatever the session holds,
and carries every field the resolver reads. At 0.47 ms and 6 KB for six panes,
two polls a second come to about a thousandth of a core.

## Decide from freshly read state

**Every poll reads the session and throws the result away again.** A tab's
name is derived from the state read for that poll, which is what makes the
resolver's determinism worth anything: identical session state always yields an
identical title.

Five things are carried between polls, and each exists because a snapshot
cannot express it:

- **When each pane last changed** (`internal/state/changes.go`). A snapshot says
  what a pane holds but not when that became true, and a tab with several panes
  and none focused is named after whichever moved last. Herdr's pane revisions
  are monotonic, so comparing one poll's revisions with the last says which panes
  moved. The map is rebuilt from each snapshot, so panes that closed disappear
  from it for free.
- **What each pane was running** (`internal/reads/processes.go`, which forgets a
  read on the panes `Changes.Observe` reports as drawn, so the two cannot
  disagree on which panes moved). `PaneInfo` carries no process name, so naming a
  pane after the program in it costs a `pane.process_info` request per pane.
  Measured against an eight-pane session, a read is 0.17 ms and the snapshot
  before it 1.35 ms, so making one for every pane every poll cost as much again
  as the snapshot — and on a session where nothing is happening, every one of
  those reads returns what the last already said. A pane whose revision has not
  moved is running what it usually was, so its answer is reused until the
  revision moves. That test is a hint rather than a guarantee, and it was
  measured to be one: over ten minutes of a live eight-pane session the
  foreground processes changed nine times and the revision moved with them only
  four, one pane going `env` → `node` → `esbuild` → `fish` with its revision
  held at 10 throughout. A revision says the pane *drew*, which starting a
  command usually but not always provokes. So the reuse is bounded twice: by the
  revision, which catches the common case in the very next poll, and by
  `processRefresh` (2 s), which is what actually bounds how wrong the answer can
  be.

  Only the pane a tab is named from is asked about, so the request is per tab
  rather than per pane. The reuse still earns its keep: focus moves between the
  panes of a tab, and what was read for one is still there when it comes back.
- **How far each agent transcript has been read** (`internal/claude/transcript.go`).
  A transcript is append-only, so a poll reads the bytes appended since the last
  one rather than the file: a session that has run all day is megabytes, and
  re-reading it twice a second to learn the one line that changed would cost
  more than every other read in the loop together. What is kept per session is a
  path, a byte offset and the topic read so far. Sessions the snapshot no longer
  holds are dropped the same way panes are.

  A session whose transcript is *not* found is remembered too. Herdr can name a
  session before the agent has written a line of it, so the search has to be
  repeated — but finding the file means scanning every project directory the
  user has, and doing that twice a second for the life of a pane costs more than
  every other read in the loop. A failed search is therefore left alone for
  `locateRetry` (10 s).
- **What Auto Title last named each tab** (`internal/labels`), which is
  how a rename by the user is told from the plugin's own work. That is a design
  of its own: [manual rename protection](./manual-rename-protection.md).
- **What Auto Title last reported for each workspace, and when**
  (`internal/app/topics.go`). A snapshot does carry each workspace's tokens, but
  keyed by name alone, whoever reported them, and with no expiry, so it can say
  neither whether a topic is this plugin's nor when it runs out. Every
  report lives `topicTTL` (60 s) in Herdr, and an unchanged topic is sent again
  once its last report is `topicRefresh` (20 s) old: a third of the lifetime,
  so two missed refreshes and a restart still fit inside it. The map is rebuilt
  from each snapshot's workspaces, as the pane map is. See
  [the workspace topic](#the-workspace-topic).

One consequence worth stating: **the interval is the rename rate.** A tab
changes name at most once per poll however fast its pane is churning, so
`HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_POLL_MS` is both the freshness knob and the calm knob.

## One poll

1. `session.snapshot` — the whole session in one request.
2. `Changes.Observe` — note which panes' revisions advanced, and return them.
3. `Labels.Pass` — open the poll's pass over the labels, which for tabs and
   panes alike drops bookkeeping for what the session no longer holds and
   releases a lock whose owner has moved on. This runs off the snapshot's own
   labels, because it is what decides which tabs and panes the next steps can
   skip, and a pass cannot be asked anything before it has run.
4. `tabsIn` — assemble tabs with their panes from the snapshot alone. Nothing
   is read here: assembly is what says which pane will be asked about.
   `Reader.Poll` opens the poll's reads, forgetting what was read of the panes
   step 2 returned and of panes and agent sessions that are gone.
5. Per tab (`nameTab`): skip it if locked, otherwise read the one pane the tab
   is named from (`Poll.Fill`), resolve a title, then check whether the
   label moved under us and rename when the result differs from the label the
   tab already carries (`Pass.Tab`).
6. Per tab again (`namePanes`), and only when pane naming is on: read the tab's
   own pane even if the tab is locked, and every pane nobody has claimed; name
   all of them at once against the tab (`ResolvePanes`); then `Pass.Pane`
   checks each name against the pane's own label, exactly as step 5 does for
   the tab.
7. Per workspace (`reportTopics`), unless topics are turned off: read the
   active tab's pane and report its topic when it changed or is due for a
   refresh — [the workspace topic](#the-workspace-topic).

**Without pane naming, only the pane that names its tab is read**, and only
while its tab is nobody's. `pane.process_info` is asked about the panes that moved since they
were last read, reusing the last answer for the rest; a pane whose processes
cannot be read simply has none, and a failed read is not remembered as an
answer. `Poll.Fill` reads a pane once per poll however often it is asked, except
that a read which failed with time left is made again by the next `Fill`, so a
workspace's topic, read after its tab, need not wait a poll for it. That pane's
directory is read for the branch it has checked out, every
poll and with nothing kept between polls: two small file reads at 0.038 ms are
cheaper than the bookkeeping that would keep a stale answer. A pane holding an
agent that is working in another directory of the same repository costs a second
such read, because the branch is taken from where the agent is. Inside the poll
the reads are memoized by directory, so a poll walks once per distinct directory
rather than once per tab, which is what stops the tabs of one project — and two
panes whose agents share a worktree — walking the same tree once each; see
[title resolution](./title-resolution.md#the-git-branch).

The reads are left out rather than made and discarded because a tab is named
from one pane (`TabState.Context`) and a locked tab is not named at all. A
four-pane tab therefore costs one process request rather than four, and a
session the user has named by hand costs the snapshot and nothing else. The
choice of pane is made from state the snapshot already carries — focus, agent
status, and which pane last drew — so it is made once, when the tab is built,
and both the reads and the resolver take that pane rather than choosing again.

**Deduplication is what keeps the loop quiet.** The snapshot reports each tab's
current label, and a rename is skipped when the resolved title already equals
it — which is also what stops a rename from provoking the next one. A session
where every tab already carries the right name, and whose panes are sitting
still, issues nothing beyond the snapshot itself.

**Naming panes turns the per-tab read into a per-pane one.** With
`HERDR_AUTO_TITLE_PANES` on, step 6 reads every pane of every tab rather than
the one its tab speaks through, so the four-pane tab above costs four process
requests instead of one, and a tab the user has claimed is read as well, because
its panes are still named against it. The reads a poll has already spent are not
spent again — `Poll.Fill` reads a pane once however often it is asked, the git
checkouts are memoized by directory, and a pane holding still keeps its last
process answer — but the floor is one read per pane, which is why it can be
turned off ([configuration](./configuration.md)).

The whole poll is bounded by `PollTimeout` (5 s). A tab that closed between the
snapshot and its rename answers `tab_not_found`, which is expected rather than an
error; a pane that closed answers `pane_not_found` and is treated the same way.

## When Herdr is not there

A connection lives for exactly one request, so there is nothing to reconnect and
no connection state to reconcile. An outage is simply a run of failed dials, and
recovery is the first dial that succeeds.

- **No poll failing is fatal, the first one included.** Herdr launches a plugin
  through a one-shot startup hook rather than supervising it, so a plugin that
  gave up would stay dead for the rest of the session — and Herdr's socket can
  be a moment behind the process it just launched. Nothing carried between polls
  is spoiled by a failure, so the next tick simply tries again.
- **Polls keep their usual rate through an outage.** A failed dial to an absent
  socket costs microseconds, and the rate is what makes recovery immediate.
- **The logging backs off instead.** At two polls a second, an hour of Herdr
  being down is seven thousand identical warnings. `failureLog`
  (`internal/app/failures.go`) reports the first failure and then only as the
  run of them doubles, which turns that hour into thirteen lines, and a line on
  the way out says how many polls were missed.

The only failure that stops the process is a missing `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`, caught
in `herdr.New` before the loop is ever entered. What else ends a run is not a
failure at all: another server on the socket, below.

Measured on a live session: with the socket removed for eight seconds the
process stayed up and polls resumed the moment it returned; started with no
socket at all, it stayed up for ten seconds on five warnings and named every tab
as soon as the socket appeared.

## A successor on the socket

Herdr starts a plugin through a one-shot startup hook and forgets it. Read from
the Herdr source: `start_plugin_command` in `src/app/api/plugins/runtime.rs`
spawns the command and only waits on it, keeping no handle; `complete_shutdown`
in `src/server/headless/lifecycle.rs` closes clients and removes the socket
files, and touches no plugin process; and `src/server/headless/bootstrap.rs`
calls `run_plugin_startup_hooks` from both of its entry points, a fresh start
and a live handoff import. So a server that stops leaves its Auto Title
running, and the next server starts one of its own.

Two instances are worse than one. Both dial the same socket, and when they
disagree — after a settings change, the old one still runs the old
configuration — each reads the other's rename as the user's and locks the tab
(see [manual rename protection](./manual-rename-protection.md)).

So each instance knows which server it answers to, and leaves when that
changes. `Client.Server` reads the socket's identity the way Herdr itself tells
its own socket from a successor's (`socket_file_identity` in `src/ipc.rs`): on
macOS and Linux the socket file's device and inode, which a fresh bind renews;
on Windows the marker Herdr writes into the socket file when it binds the pipe,
its pid and start time. `App.superseded` records the first identity a poll can
read and ends the run on the first poll that reads a different one. An
unreadable identity decides nothing: the socket is gone while Herdr is down and
can be a moment late at startup, and neither is a successor. The process exits
with status 0, because the successor's own startup hook has already started the
instance that replaces it.

`App.successor` asks the claim first and the socket second, both in one place
so a poll has one way out. The claim usually answers for a new server too,
because that server's instance claims the same session; the socket is what is
left to read when there was no configuration directory to claim in.

## A successor on the claim

The socket only changes when the server does, and a server restart closes the
session. Herdr runs startup hooks at no other time — not on install, link,
enable, a configuration reload or a client attaching — so without a way to
restart the plugin alone, a new version, a changed `config.env` and a hung
instance each cost the user their session. `herdr-auto-title restart` is that
way, wired to the manifest's one action, and it rests on a claim
(`internal/instance`).

**The claim.** An instance starting writes its pid into a file of Auto Title's
own, `instances/<hash of the socket path>.json` under the platform's
configuration directory — the last of those the configuration note lists and
never the first that holds a file, so every instance finds the same claim. The
socket names the session, so a user running two sessions has two claims and
the instances never displace each other; it is hashed because a path is not a
file name. Herdr's own `HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR` is per plugin rather than per
session, which is why it is not used. The file is written in one call rather
than through a rename: it is one line, and a reader that catches it half
written treats that as nothing said and looks again next poll. A claim that is
gone altogether — the user emptied the directory — is nobody's, and no run
ends over it.

**Newest wins.** `App.poll` reads the claim before every poll and ends the run
when another pid holds it, with nothing renamed that poll. `Take` waits for
the pid it displaced to exit — `LeaveTimeout`, a poll past its deadline plus
up to five seconds for the old instance's own interval, which the new one
cannot know — and only then are the manual-name locks loaded and the session
polled. It never kills: an instance old enough not to look at claims is left
running, warned about, and the README says that upgrade needs one `herdr
server stop`.

**Nothing is removed on the way out.** A claim naming a pid that has gone
displaces nobody, which is how a crashed instance is already handled, so
deleting the file at exit would buy only the case of a pid the system reuses
after a clean exit — and it would cost a race the run cannot afford: an
instance told to leave would delete the claim its successor had just written.
A wait that times out on a reused pid costs a warning, nothing worse.

**Ready.** After its first poll that read a snapshot the instance writes its
pid into a marker beside the claim, `<hash>.ready.json`. A file of its own,
because that first poll can outlast a takeover: marking ready in the claim
would write over the newer instance's pid with the old one's, and the wrong
instance would survive. An instance is ready when it holds the claim and the
marker names it, and that is what the restart waits for: `LeaveTimeout` plus
`PollTimeout`, passed in from `main` so one deadline cannot drift from the
other, for the new pid to hold the claim, be ready, and the old pid to be
gone, watching the child as well so an instance that exits at once is reported
with its status rather than waited for. An exit is only a failure while nobody
newer holds the claim: two restarts a moment apart end with the second one's
instance naming the session, which is what both actions then report. The
outcome goes to `notification.show` and to the action's log; a notice Herdr
chose not to show is not a failure.
Without that directory there is no claim, and the action refuses
rather than start an instance nothing could wait for or displace.

The new instance is started with stdio on the null device and detached — its
own session on macOS and Linux, no console or process group on Windows. Herdr
reads an action's output to its end, so a child holding the action's pipes
would keep the action "running" and hold one of the thirty-two plugin
command slots for as long as it lived. `os.StartProcess` rather than
`os/exec`, which the linter forbids: the program is the binary's own path and
the arguments are fixed, so nothing terminal-derived is run.

`make run` takes part: it claims, displaces the instance Herdr started, and on
Ctrl+C leaves, its claim behind it naming a pid that is gone and so displacing
nothing.

## Shutdown

`signal.NotifyContext` in `cmd/herdr-auto-title/main.go` cancels the context on
`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`; `Run` returns and the process exits, as it does when a
successor takes the socket or the claim. There are no
debounce timers to cancel and no socket to close, because a connection never
outlives the call that made it.

Every source resolves synchronously inside the poll, so when `Run` returns there
is nothing left running.

## The workspace topic

A poll ends by reporting what each workspace's active tab is doing as the
workspace's `topic` token (`workspace.report_metadata`), which Herdr draws
wherever the user's `ui.sidebar.spaces.rows` ask for `$topic`. The label is
never touched: Herdr keeps an unnamed workspace's label on its pane's directory
by itself, and any rename would freeze it there. Going last matters only to a
poll cut short: a topic is what such a poll gives up, not a tab.

The active tab is the snapshot's `active_tab_id`. A snapshot that names none,
or names a tab that has closed since, is read through the workspace's first
tab, and a workspace with no tabs is sent nothing. The topic is that tab's
pane, read through the chain [title resolution](./title-resolution.md#the-workspace-topic)
describes, and an empty topic is sent as `null`, which clears it at once
rather than waiting out the lifetime.

A report is sent only when the topic differs from the last one this instance
sent, or when that one is `topicRefresh` old. A workspace this instance has not
reported to yet is the one exception: an empty topic is still sent as `null`
if the snapshot shows a topic, which is how a restarted instance takes down what
its predecessor left rather than letting it stand for up to a minute. Nothing is
sent on the way out, since a leaving instance clearing its topics would race
its successor's first reports; the lifetime alone takes them down, and turning
the setting off leaves them to fade the same way.

Auto Title takes the `topic` token of every workspace as its own. Herdr keys a
token by name alone, not by who reported it, so another program reporting
`topic` would share that one value, and the two would overwrite each other at
every change and refresh. Nothing guards against that; it is unsupported.

A report that fails never cuts the poll short. `workspace_not_found` means the
workspace closed after the snapshot, and it is forgotten. A report Herdr did not
answer counts as sent, as a rename does, since Herdr may still apply it seconds
later; if it lands after a newer topic, the next refresh puts the newer one back
within `topicRefresh`. Any other refusal is one Herdr will make again for the
same value, so the value is remembered and not sent again until the topic
changes.

The reads ask for nothing of their own in the ordinary case: the pane a topic
comes from is the pane its tab was already named through, and a poll never
spends the same read twice. The exception is a tab the user has claimed, which
is not read for its own sake: with pane naming off, a topic above one costs the
pane read that tab did not; with it on, as it ships, that pane is already read
for the panes it names, so the topic still costs nothing.
